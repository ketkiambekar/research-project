# research-project

In this project we created a model to predict the per squarefoot housing prices from the [NYC rolling sales data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page) and the [pluto dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page), taking into consideration the number of covid cases per day. 

We compared the results from an LSTM time series model versus ARIMA, which one gives a more accurate prediction of per square foot prices in NYC real estate market.

The process is documented in the 'CS700B Final Report.pdf' included in this repository.
