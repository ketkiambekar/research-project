# research-project

In this project we aimed at predicting NYC per squarefoot housing prices from the [NYC rolling sales data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page) and the [pluto dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page), taking into consideration the number of covid cases per day.
